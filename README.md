# PIC_RFM69
Send packet from PIC12LF1840T39A to RFM69HCW

This code sends a packet from the PIC to the HopeRF module as used on the Adafruit Feather M0.

It sends it in a way that the RFM69 can handle natively, including CRC check.

With this example it should be easy to send from the very inexpensive and powerful PIC chip to the ubiquitous HopeRF RFM69 module.


PIC Code is based on the Microchip Keeloq examples.
